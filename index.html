            <p>Khichuri is a traditional Bangladeshi recipe. This is a wholesome comfort meal of rice, lentils and
                vegetables, altogether. There are different ways of cooking Khichuri. Plain Khichuri generally prepared with
                rice and moong or masoor dal is the best food we can have when we are sick. It is one of the first foods
                that we give to our babies when they are 6-9 months old.</p>

            <p>Payesh is a Bengali birthday special sweet dish or dessert prepared at every home in Bengal. Payesh is a
                sugary concoction of flavourful gobindobhog rice/basmati rice & milk flavored with cardamom and bay leaves. Apart
                from West Bengal & Bangladesh, this sweet is popularly known as rice kheer(in Hindi language)or Payasam (in South
                Indian languages). Bengali payesh is quite different from other Indian rice desserts. Just because it is
                made with special flavourful rice named gobindo bhog.Though instead of gobindo bhog rice, good quality flavored
                basmati rice also can be used. However, fine & flavourful rice is a must for making payesh. Apart from
                flavourful rice,full cream milk & sugar are 2 must-used ingredients for making this dish. Traditionally
                payesh is generally prepared with sugar or chini. Though except for this chiniâ€™r payesh we have a separate gurer
                payesh recipe if you want to replace the sugar with gur.</p>
